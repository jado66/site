# Jadon Erwin's Website

Click [here](https://jado66.github.io/site/) for my website.

TODOs:
- Add graph creator with simple style controls
- Add in "Shape" ID
- Think about what belongs in a "Gameboy" and what should be part of the website by default (ex. if the orbital mechanics where rotations in three.js that would be a dope background... especially if every now and then you got a close up of Earth swinging by.
- Maybe make the gameboys mini, or have a selection of games in a real looking arcade machine. 
- Make a VR headset div that when clicked upon opens up my VR website. 
  - The site can be a house with changing textures like the one three.js examples 
  - The house has large "picture" frames kind of like Mario64 but when you get close you realize it isn't a picture frame. It is a window and on the inside is a small room, but is larger than should fit. 
  - One room I want it to be black with a white (very visible) paper airplane that flies itself around following a path from the "The Nature of Code" textbook.
  - The house wraps around itself using teleport to appear as if it is non-euclideon geometry. 
    - You go up the stairs to the "upstairs" but end up back on the main floor appearing from the basement stairs and vice versa. Teleport happens midway through. 
  - Another room should have a paint splatter cannon (which you can pick up and move to wherever including hitting the paper airplane out of the sky lol) and inside the room will be different geometric walls to make the paint splatter more interesting.
