# Jadon Erwin's Website

Click [here](https://jado66.github.io/site/) for my website.

TODOs:
- Add graph creator with simple style controls
- Add in "Shape" ID
- Think about what belongs in a "Gameboy" and what should be part of the website by default (ex. if the orbital mechanics where rotations in three.js that would be a dope background... especially if every now and then you got a close up of Earth swinging by.
- Maybe make the gameboys mini, or have a selection of games in a real looking arcade machine. 
- Make a VR headset div that when clicked upon opens up my VR website.
